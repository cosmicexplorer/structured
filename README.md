structured
==========

Package for manipulating structured data in R. If that seems vague, it's because it's also a catch-all for things I'm (reluctantly!) reimplementing to support research I'm doing with the Irish Lab at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

# Sections
1. read file into a data structure based on a declarative representation of *complex*, (maybe) binary data in the file/connection
2. check and coerce arguments
