*TODO: fix name*

1. Define canonical data transformations *for humans* to *easily* create *accidentally-documented* and *completely reproducible* R scripts which *correctly use complex analytical methods*.
2. Execute *complex, massive streaming workflows* with *high concurrency* on *any machine or cluster*. *Automatically snapshot and cache* each stage of execution to *avoid redundant work* and *stop mistakes from invalidating months of work*.
3. Make *novel, complex analyses* using *state-of-the-art research* into libraries which are *immediately usable* for *scientists without a programming background* and *programmers without a Ph.D*. *Effectively* support many different workflows *without introducing kitchen sink interfaces*.

If any parts of the above goals seem infeasible, remember that only a Sith deals in absolutes.

"accidentally-documented" is a made-up phrase which means something like "self-documenting", but is a little more descriptive and a little less pretentious.

See [dag.md](R/dag.md) for some thoughts on how this can/will be done.
